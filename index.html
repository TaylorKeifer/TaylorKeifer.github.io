  <h3>Electrical Harness Design</h3>
  <img src="harness_1.jpg" alt="Electrical Harness 1">
  <p>I design custom electrical wiring harnesses tailored to specific vehicles, machines, and operating environments. My process starts with understanding system requirements—power distribution, signal integrity, environmental exposure, and regulatory constraints—then translating those needs into reliable, serviceable harness layouts.<br>
  <img src="harness_2.jpg" alt="Electrical Harness 2">
  <p> I develop schematics, connector pinouts, and routing strategies, selecting appropriate wire gauges, shielding, connectors, and protective materials to ensure durability, ease of installation, and long-term reliability. Designs account for vibration, heat, moisture, maintenance access, and manufacturing efficiency, and are documented clearly for production, testing, and troubleshooting.</p>

  <h3>Electrical Enclosure Design</h3>
  <img src="plc_enclosure_design_1.jpg" alt="Electrical Enclosure Design">
  <p>I design custom electrical enclosures that protect critical components while supporting safe, reliable system operation. My work includes enclosure layout, component placement, thermal considerations, and selection of materials and ingress protection to match the operating environment.<br>
  <p> Designs account for electrical safety, heat dissipation, service access, and installation constraints. I develop detailed layouts and documentation that support efficient assembly, compliance, and long-term maintainability in industrial and mobile applications.</p>

  <h3>Controls Schematics</h3>
  <img src="controls_1.jpg" alt="Controls Schematic 1">
  <p>I create clear, accurate installation schematics that translate system designs into practical, installer-ready documentation. These schematics define wiring routes, connector pinouts, grounding points, and component locations, ensuring systems can be installed correctly, efficiently, and consistently.<br>
  <img src="controls_2.jpg" alt="Controls Schematic 2">
  <p> My drawings prioritize clarity and usability—reducing installation errors, simplifying commissioning, and supporting troubleshooting and future service. Documentation is structured to align with manufacturing and field installation workflows, enabling smooth handoff from design to build.</p>

  <h3>Hydraulic Systems</h3>
  <img src="hydraulics_1.jpg" alt="Hydraulic Systems">
  <p>I design custom mobile hydraulic systems tailored to vehicle-specific and application-specific requirements. My work covers system architecture, component selection, and circuit design to achieve precise control, reliability, and safe operation under demanding real-world conditions.<br>
    <p> Designs account for load cases, duty cycles, pressure and flow requirements, thermal behavior, and integration with electrical and control systems. I develop clear schematics and documentation that support efficient installation, commissioning, and long-term serviceability in mobile and off-highway environments.</p>
  <h3>Pneumatic Systems</h3>
  <img src="pneumatic_1.jpg" alt="Pneumatic Systems">
  <p>I design custom pneumatic systems tailored to application-specific requirements, focusing on reliable actuation, control, and efficiency. My work includes system layout, component selection, and circuit design to ensure consistent performance across varying operating conditions.<br>
  <p>Designs account for pressure requirements, air quality, duty cycles, response times, and environmental factors. I develop clear schematics and documentation that support efficient installation, commissioning, and long-term serviceability in industrial and mobile applications.<br>

  <h3>Piping Systems</h3>
  <img src="piping_1.jpg" alt="Piping Systems">
  <p>I design custom fuel piping systems for jet refuelers, engineered to meet stringent safety, performance, and regulatory requirements. My work includes system layout, component selection, and routing design to ensure reliable fuel delivery, pressure control, and contamination prevention.<br>
  <p>Designs account for flow rates, pressure losses, thermal expansion, vibration, and service access, as well as integration with pumps, valves, filtration, and metering systems. I produce clear schematics and installation documentation that support safe operation, efficient assembly, and long-term maintainability in demanding airport and mobile fueling environments.<br>

  <h3>Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs)</h3>
  <img src="MainTouchscreen_1.png" alt="Human-Machine Interface">
  <p>I design custom human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that translate complex system behavior into clear, intuitive operator displays. My focus is on usability, situational awareness, and operational efficiency—ensuring operators can quickly understand system status and respond confidently.<br>
  <p> HMI designs incorporate alarm management, status visualization, diagnostics, and user workflows tailored to the application and operating environment. I develop interfaces that integrate seamlessly with control systems and are documented to support consistent deployment, commissioning, and long-term maintenance.</p>

  <img src="alert_popup_1.png" alt="Alerts for Safe Use">

  <h3>Alert Logging for End User Data Collection</h3>
  <img src="alert_log_1.jpg" alt="Alert Logging for End User Data Collection">

  <h3>Extensive Guide Development</h3>
  <img src="main_touchscreen_help_slide_1.PNG" alt="Extensive Guide Development">
  <p>I develop comprehensive user guides that support effective training, safe operation, and efficient troubleshooting. Documentation is structured to make complex systems easy to understand, combining clear explanations, step-by-step procedures, and visual references.<br>
    <p> Guides cover normal operation, startup and shutdown, alarms and fault conditions, and maintenance tasks. Content is designed for both new and experienced users, reducing training time, minimizing errors, and enabling faster issue resolution in the field.</p>
