      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>For the projects shown in this portfolio, I was responsible for the end-to-end design and integration of complete vehicle systems. This included mechanical bracketry and structures, electrical systems and harnessing, pneumatic and hydraulic circuits, embedded software and PLC control logic, and full chassis integration.<br>
      <p>Every component required to make the vehicles functional—whether off-the-shelf or custom—was sourced, specified, or developed as part of the overall system architecture. My role covered the entire lifecycle from concept and design through installation, commissioning, and operational validation, ensuring all subsystems worked together as a reliable, cohesive platform.<br>
